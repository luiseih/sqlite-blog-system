# So, you want to try out IRC?

Let's begin by learning how to change your nickname from qwebirc-whatever to something more... understandable:

<code>/nick yourNewNickName</code>

Go ahead. Change yours now.

Done? OK. Let's continue...

> *What do all those funny characters mean?*

> **@** represents an operator.

> **#** represents a *channel*.

## Time to get our hands dirty!

If you want to know *who is* someone, depending on the server and the user configuration, you can look him/her up with the */whois* command.

If I'm online, go ahead and check me out with:

> /whois luiseih

Do *not* include the operator sign (@)!

One thing that you probably have already noticed is that commands begin with a forward slash **/**.

> If you wanted, you could actually hold your meetings in a channel!

Everything you say here is *heard* by anyone who happens to be present. Very much like in a conference room.

Want to get a little more personal?

You can talk in private to anyone who happens to be online with:

> /msg nicknameOfThePerson Message you want to send.

If you want to *join* or *create* a new channel, the command is:

> /join #channelYouWantToJoinOrCreate

If the channel is brand new, you will automatically become channel operator of that channel.

And if you want to part ways from it, leave the channel altogether:

> /part

Pretty simple, uh?

There are many more commands and combinations and ways of managing channels, users, servers and groups but, for a start, I think these are the very **basic** ones.
