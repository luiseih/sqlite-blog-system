Did you know that this ad was aired only ONCE?

Anyway...

My story begins with a Macintosh Plus, and its astonishing ONE megabyte in RAM (Yes, you read that right)...

Being a curious person by nature, I began to tamper with computers just for fun, but later on, I began to use them for, ahem, "software research purposes"; finding about what worked, what not and, most important, WHY.

I began doing my first technology research way before I was even out of intermediate school.

Somewhere along that line, I found out I enjoyed telling people about the many wonders and magic that laid inside that greyish box.

Friends and family stated many times that I was actually capable of making out of something mundane as a floppy disk, something worth of attention and interest. Ah, the very fine art of explaining complicated things to "normal" people.

Could that be the reason as to why I got a Bachelor Degree in Communication Science? Maybe.

Could that passion for computers that drew me into getting a Master Degree in Information Technology later on? Definitely.

I could say that I am somewhat of an hybrid, swinging between the cold, hard side of technology and the warmer, kinder side of humanity.
