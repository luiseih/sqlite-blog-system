&gt;Houston, we have separation...

On July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module Eagle separated from the Command Module Columbia and began the descent to land on the moon.

However, about two kilometres (a mile) before touching down, the ship's navigation and guidance computer triggered several alarms.

Definitely *not* the best time and place for a computer crash.

The on board computer had much less computing power than your usual modern-day cell phone and yet, the space mission rested on it. And it was failing.

Due to a hardware misconfiguration, the processor was having a hard time working out all the tasks required to land the module. The landing procedure was at risk.

Think **crash and burn**.

## What saved the day? ##

The programming skills of Margaret Hamilton did.

As part of an élite group of coders and project programming leader, she was in charge of implementing a complete set of recovery programs into the computer software to cope with hardware issues.

She had kept thinking of things that might go wrong and tried to stay ahead of them, modifying the software accordingly, even though at times some people thought that was <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/margaret-hamilton-nasa-apollo/" target="_blank">something unnecessary</a>. What could go wrong?

Hamilton designed the code to reallocate the computing resources to the most critical tasks in case of an emergency. At this point, we could safely say we were in one. Fortunately, the software delivered and the astronauts were able to complete the mission successfully.

The coding lines are now open source and you can take a look at what the Apollo Guidance computer software - codenamed "Comanche 055"- looked like. Of special interest are the comments in the program.

And, if you want the nitty-gritty of what happened and how they sorted the shortcomings out, you can head to Don Eyles paper <a href="http://www.doneyles.com/LM/Tales.html" target="_blank">"Tales from the Lunar Module Guidance Computer"</a>. He was part of that team of nifty programmers.

We have gone a long way ever since, but it is always interesting to know how things - software development in this case - became the way they are now. You probably will never see your computer software the same way again. What's your take?
